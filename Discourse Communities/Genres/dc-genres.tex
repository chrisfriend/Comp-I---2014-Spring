\section{Background and Purpose} % (fold)
\label{sec:background}
%According to Amy Devitt, ``Genres develop…because they respond appropriately to situations that writers encounter repeatedly. In principle, that is, writers \textbf{first} respond in fitting ways and hence similarly to recurring situations; \textbf{then}, the similarities among those appropriate responses become established as generic conventions. In practice, of course, genres already exist and hence already constrain responses to situations.''\footnote{Amy Devitt, ``Generalizing about Genre'' (1993, emphasis added)} 
In your educational experiences, you have  worked in writing situations after the ``generic conventions'' have been established. The rhetorical situation is always pre-determined and familiar, at least to your teachers. In this class, you have been introduced to academic journal articles and told to ``mushfake'' in that genre. All your experience has prepared you to start with the genre and write from there.

For this assignment, %we are going to break with that tradition and work against those experiences. 
instead of figuring out how to fit with an already-established genre, your goal is to peel back the conventions and see what's behind them. We are going to look at what creates a genre in the first place. You are trying to answer this question: \textbf{What are the origins, contexts of use, affordances, and constraints of a particular genre?} By analyzing the genre's origins, you will focus on the recurring rhetorical situation that created the genre you are examining.

\section{Required Reading} % (fold)
	\label{sec:readings}
	For this assignment, you will need to read ``Generalizing about Genre: New Conceptions of an Old Concept'' by Amy Devitt, available through Webcourses, plus ``Intertextuality and the Discourse Community'' by James Porter, found on pages 86--96 of your \ac{waw} text.
	% section readings (end)

\section{Procedure} % (fold)
\label{sec:procedure}
\noindent Before you write your draft:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Select a genre to study based on your in-class brainstorming. What are you interested in enough to study in depth?
			\item Collect samples of the genre. The more, the merrier, but you need at least three separate samples.
			\item Identify the scene and describe the situation in which the genre is used. Include discussions of the setting, subject, participants, and purpose of your genre. See the Genre Analysis handout for specific questions to help with this analysis.
			\item Identify and describe the genre's features. Refer to the Genre Analysis handout.
			\item Hypothesize what those elements reveal about the genre's scene/situation of use.
		\end{enumerate}
In your paper:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Make a claim about what the genre you have chosen tells us about the people who use it and the scene in which it is used.
			\item Support your claim with the evidence you gathered above.
		\end{enumerate}
To make your paper exceptional:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Identify, based on your samples, the intertextual characteristics and content specific to this genre.
			\item Evaluate how well the genre you chose meets the needs you identified. Consideration of affordances and constraints will be helpful here.
		\end{enumerate}

\section{Formatting} % (fold)
\label{sec:formatting}
As with the previous assignments, you are expected to use \textsc{mla} formatting conventions, including:
\begin{itemize}
	\item double-spaced lines,
	\item one-inch margins on all sides and half-inch indents for paragraphs,
	\item a 12-point typeface with serifs (like Times New Roman, \emph{not} Calibri), and
	\item parenthetical citations, where appropriate, and a Works Cited page.
\end{itemize}
