	\section{Required Reading} % (fold)

	\section{Procedure} % (fold)
	\label{sec:procedure}
		For this assignment, you are  applying the  characteristics identified by Swales on pages 471–73 of your \ac{wawbk} textbook. Show that a specific group you have been a part of is a discourse community.
		\begin{compactitem}
			\item Before you write,
		\begin{compactenum}
			\item brainstorm several groups you are (or have been) in that you think might be considered discourse communities and
			\item consider how those groups use text and language, then choose one group to study. %closely
		\end{compactenum}
		\item In your paper,
		\begin{compactenum}
			\item show how the group you chose possesses each of the six defining characteristics from Swales and
			\item find connections between characteristics to show how they help the group function.
		\end{compactenum}
		\item To make your paper exceptional, also
		\begin{compactenum}
			\item identify which characteristics have greater priority than others, perhaps for group function or for new members seeking membership and
			\item show how the combination of those six characteristics form the group's sense of identity.
		\end{compactenum}
		\end{compactitem}
	% section process (end)

	\section{Evaluation} % (fold)
	\label{sec:rubric}
	Your task for this assignment is to identify a specific group of people as being a discourse community. Your work will be assessed using the evaluation criteria presented in Table~\ref{tab:rubric}.

	\section{Formatting} % (fold)
	\label{sec:formatting}
	As with the previous assignments, you are expected to use \textsc{mla} formatting conventions, including:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item double-spaced lines,
		\item one-inch margins on all sides and half-inch indents for paragraphs,
		\item a 12-point typeface with serifs (like Times New Roman, \emph{not} Calibri), and
		\item parenthetical citations, where appropriate, and a Works Cited page.
